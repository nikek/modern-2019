# Modern Web App - Summer 2019

Awesome tools combined for the current time

## Areas

- Views - React
  View layer presenting data and UI to users and handling interactions from users.
- Routing - hookrouter
  https://github.com/Paratron/hookrouter
- Styling - emotion
  emotion styled components and makeStyles -> useStyle hook
- Bundling - parcel

## General preferences

- Prefer putting business logic in a js module. Much logic is tied to data that is required to be in the react sync cycles/lifecycles.

## Not in phase one

- Typescript
- Server side rendering
- Code splitting with lazy loading page components
- Service workers - caching and offline
