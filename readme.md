# Modern Web App - Summer 2019

Awesome tools combined for the current time

## Areas

- UI - React
  UI layer presenting navigation and data, plus orchestrating user interaction.
- Routing - hookrouter
  https://github.com/Paratron/hookrouter
- Styling - emotion
  emotion styled components and makeStyles -> useStyle hook ... maybe, tbd
- Bundling - parcel
  Dev server and building static site

## Ideas for this project

- Prefer putting business logic in a js module. Though much logic is tied to data that is required to be in the react sync cycles/lifecycles.
- This is a plugin architecture playground. APIs change and code moves around with every commit.

## Topics for phase one

- What's in core vs in plugins
- Routing
  - Code splitting with lazy loading page components
- State management
- Authentication and user
- Testing

## Upcoming phases, maybe

- Instrumentation, metrics and insights
  events to hook into for tracking usage
- Typescript
- Server side rendering
- Service workers - caching and offline
